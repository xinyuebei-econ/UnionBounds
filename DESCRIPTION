Description: The UnionBounds R package calculates confidence intervals for target parameters whose identified set is a union bound. It is based on the modified conditional inference methodology proposed by Bei (2024). The package includes three primary functions:(1)CI_ModifiedConditional: Works for general union bounds as defined in Bei (2024) Equation 1.(2)CI_RM: Computes confidence intervals for the treatment effect under relative magnitudes relaxation, whose identified set is given in Rambachan and Roth (2023) Section 2.4.1.(3)CI_SDRM: Calculates confidence intervals for the treatment effect under second differences relative magnitudes relaxation, whose identified set is given in Rambachan and Roth (2023) Section 2.4.5.
